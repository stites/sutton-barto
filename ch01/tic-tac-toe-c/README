Tic-Tac-Toe using TD(0).	Written by Amy McGovern amy@cs.umass.edu 09/96	permission given to modify the code as long as you keep	my name at the top----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------How to install Tic-Tac-Toe:0) To run the code, untar the ttt.tar file into a directory1) Type 'which wish' at your prompt (*) Note: you need to use wish 4.2or greater.2) Change the first line of 'ttt.tcl' to reflect the path to wishversion 4.2 or greater.3) Type 'ttt.tcl' at the prompt.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------How to use Tic-Tac-Toe:0) To play against the learned player, simply click on an open squareto make a move.  When the game is over, the winning combination (ifthere is one) will be highlighted.  Click 'New game' to play again.1) To change who the opponent is or who the learning system trainsagainst, click on the options window.  Change the computer opponent toeither learning on or off.  Change the training opponent to whicheveropponent you want to train against.  Human is yourself.  The 'FirstAvailable Move' player simply scans the board starting at the top andmakes the first available move.  'Random' makes a random move at eachstep.  'Optimal' searches through the whole game tree and makes theoptimal move.  'TD' means the system will train against itself.  Clickon 'Train' to train for the number of iterations shown in the box.Change the number for more or less iterations.The value function is automatically saved each game into'training/<opponent name>_<random seed number>'.  You can load in asaved value function by using 'Load V from a table'.  Type the path tothe value function and click 'Load'.2) The 'View V' function will shown a bunch of miniature boards andwhat the current value for each of the boards is.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Troubleshooting:Q: Help, I get the following error:   Tcl_AppInit failed: version mismatch: library scripts expect Tcl   version 7.5b1 or later but the loaded version is only 106A: Make sure you are using Wish 4.2 or greater.  Q: Help, it says 'command not found':A: Make sure you added the correct path to wish at the top of ttt.tcl.Also, put a #! in front of the path.  For example, if 'which wish'returns '/usr/bin/wish', then make the first line of ttt.tcl read'#!/usr/bin/wish' (without the quotes).Q: Help, it says 'Permission Denied' when I type 'ttt.tcl'.  A: Make sure the executable bit is set.  To do this, type 'chmod +x ttt.tcl'Q: Help, when I exit, it says 'Couldn't open V/...' No such file or directory.A: The program saves it's value functions and training information totwo separate directories.  Make sure you have a 'V' directory and a'training' directory (or comment out the line which saves the valuefunction).Q: Help, when I try to train it gives me a message saying 'Error:couldn't open training/.... No such file or directory'.A: See answer to above question.
